2.  **Analysis**: Run `dart analyze --fatal-infos` and ensure there are zero issues (including info-level issues).
3.  **Tests**: Run `dart test` and ensure all tests pass successfully.
4.  **Skill Validation**: If any skill files were modified, run `dart run dart_skills_lint -d .agents/skills` to ensure they are valid.
